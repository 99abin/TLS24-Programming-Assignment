How the device works:
1. The 16x2 LCD will display a timer indicating when the device will open, allowing the food inside the device to be released.
2. When the timer reaches 0, the servo will rotate 180 degrees, indicating that the device has opened.
3. The servo will then rotate back to 0 degrees, indicating that the device has closed again.
4. The timer will be reset to 5 seconds again (assuming 5 hours).
